SUMMARY:
This file contains my notes on the files in the pre-processor directory.  
There are currently two subdirectories, ascii2hdf and cdc2hdf.  The code in
ascii2hdf will take the old-style ED2 met driver files (written in ASCII) and
convert them into HDF5.  The code in in cdc2hdf will take the netcdf files
downloaded from the CDC website and convert them into HDF5.

THIS CODE WAS COMPILED AND TESTED ON MOORCROFTH.  USE ELSEWHERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

---------------------------------

ascii2hdf/

Recall that the met driver files for IMETFLG = 2 (an SOI run) did not have
a header, but that the met driver files for IMETFLG = 1 (regional offline 
run) did have a header.  Currently, the ascii2hdf/ code only works with the
IMETFLG=2 type files.  I am working on generalizing it.

To generate the HDF5 files, set six variables at the top of convert_ascii.f90:
1) first_year:  the first year you want to process
2) last_year: the last year you want to process
3) findir: location of the current met driver files (in ASCII)
4) foutdir: location to write the new met driver files (HDF5)
5) frqin: frequency (in seconds) at which non-solar-radiation fields were
          written to the ASCII file.
6) frqin_rad: freqency (in seconds) at which the solar radiation fields 
              were written to the ASCII file.

Once you have set these quantities, just make and run:

moorcrofth > make
moorcrofth > ./convert_ascii

Let me know if you have any problems.
