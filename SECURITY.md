# Security Policy

ED2 is a numerical model that reads in multiple data sets and generates simulation output files. The code development is guided towards making the code safe to use and should not pose any system vulnerability. 
However, we recommend using only data that come from trusted sources and to use the model with full understanding that the simulations can be memory intensive and require large storage depending on the configuration.

Please do not post anything on issues, discussions or pull requests that can lead to data deletion or can damage operating systems. This is not acceptable through our code of conduct.

## Supported Versions

We strongly recommend to keep the code up to date with the most recent tags and commits.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a potential vulnerability in the ED2 code, the best way of reporting it is by documenting it as an issue. If you know how to fix the vulnerability, please submit a pull request and the development team will address the matter and follow up with you through GitHub.
