  subroutine filltab_alltypes

    ! =================================================
    !
    ! This subroutine is the main driver for filling
    ! filling the var_table of ED variables.  On a
    ! serial computing environment, this routine should be
    ! called near the end of the initialization process
    ! after the hierarchical tree structure has been
    ! trimmed via fusion/fission.  Similiarly, this
    ! routine should be called after any fusion/fission
    ! process, assuming that the major vtable structures
    ! have been deallocated prior to reallocation.
    !
    ! In a paralell environment, this routine should
    ! operate in a similiar fashion on each of the compute
    ! nodes.  It is designed such that the compute nodes
    ! will write hyperslabs of data in parallel to a
    ! joing HDF5 dataset as "collective-chunked" data
    ! The modifications that must be made after running this
    ! subroutine, are that the indexes should account
    ! for the offset of the current compute node.
