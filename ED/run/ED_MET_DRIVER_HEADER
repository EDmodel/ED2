# README
# Line 1:  Number of file formats (n)
# Then, loop over n:
#    Prefixes of the file format
#    nlon, nlat, dx, dy, xmin, ymin
#    Number of variables contained in this format 
#    list of variables for each format
#    frequency at which variables are updated, for each var, or the scalar value if the variable type is 4 (see next)
#    do: (0) read gridded data - no time interpolation
#        (1) read gridded data - with time interpolatation
#        (2) read gridded data - constant in time, not changing (if this is lat/lon, will overwrite line 3 information)
#        (3) read one value representing the whole grid - no time interpolation
#        (4) specify a constant for all polygons, constant in time (most likely reference height)
# End loop over n.
# VARIABLE NAMES FOLLOW NCEP NAMING CONVENTIONS:
# nbdsf:  near IR beam downward solar radiation [W/m2]
# nddsf:  near IR diffuse downward solar radiation [W/m2]
# vbdsf:  visible beam downward solar radiation [W/m2]
# vddsf:  visible diffuse downward solar radiation [W/m2]
# prate:  precipitation rate [kg_H2O/m2/s]
# dlwrf:  downward long wave radiation [W/m2]
# pres: pressure [Pa]
# hgt: geopotential height [m]
# ugrd: zonal wind [m/s]
# vgrd: meridional wind [m/s]
# sh: specific humidity [kg_H2O/kg_air]
# tmp: temperature [K]
# co2: surface co2 concentration [ppm]
# lat: grid of latitude coordinates, if this variable is present line 3 is ignored
# lon: grid of longitude coordinates, if this variable is present line 3 is ignored
#
# Note: if CO2 is provided in a single file format independently, it will NOT be cycled/shuffled
# This can be useful when conducting historical runs when met needs to be cycled but not CO2
